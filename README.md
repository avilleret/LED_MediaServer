LED_MediaServer
===============

This is a LED mediaserver and mapper build to control PixelPusher driven displays.
It's build with open-source tools and is indeed open-source itself.
It's based on pure-data and Gem and Processing sketches.

A Pd patch does the media management and can be fully automated with i-score.
A Processing sketch talk with PixelPusher boards.

It was born from the *Corps Diplomatique* project by Halory Goerger.
